- 👋 Hi, I’m @akmuss
- 👀 I’m interested in my family, my pets, and golf!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a full-stack developer!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that don't exceed intermediate skill levels since I am still new 😅 
- 📫 How to reach me best is through here - I am on every day!
